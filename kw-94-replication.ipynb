Occupation B is more skill intensive in the sense that own experience has higher return than is the case for Occupation A. There is some general skill learned in Occupation A which is transferable to Occupation B. However, work experience is occupation-specific in Occupation B."

    "This section replicates Table 6 in Keane and Wolpin (1994) which studies the effect of different amounts of tuition subsidies. First, we are going to show the effect of the tuition subsidy on each of the parametrizations for a sample of 1,000 simulated individuals. After that, Table 6 is replicated where the policy effect is measured as the average difference in experience for 40 samples with 100 invididuals with and without the tutition subsidy. The authors apply a 500 USD tuition subsidy on the first parametrization, 1000 USD on the second and 2000 USD on the third parametrization.\n",
