# Monte-Carlo Uncertainty Quantification for Keane/Wolpin(1997)

This repository conducts a Monte-Carlo Uncertainty Quantification for statistics
in *Keane/Wolpin(1997)*. Thereby, the statistics are computed.



## Replication

To solve and simulate the model, I rely on the open-source software [*respy*](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/respy) and [*estimagic*](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic).
Because the Monte-Carlo simulations require a long computation time, the relevant data
is stored as pickles in `auxiliary\results`.
To illustrate the program, the programs are run for a small number of iterations in the jupyter notebook
