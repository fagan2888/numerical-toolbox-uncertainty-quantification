    "Uncertainty Quantification is a increasingly well-established toolkit in many applied sciences such as metereology, climatology, engineering, virology etc. Models to which the tools of UQ are applied are, amongst others, weather and climate models, nuclear reactor models and HIV models. Applied UQ aims to analyze the uncertainty of mathematical models that may come from various sources. The sources can be categorized in (i) model errors or discrepancies, (ii) input uncertainties, (iii) numerical errors and uncertainties and (iv) measurement errors and uncertainties. Once they are identified, the model can be improved. Given the magnitude of uncertainty in most models that are used to make - oftentimes tremendously important - decisions, Uncertainty Quantification should be part of every serious applied, model-based research and practice."

    "## Uncertainty Quantification in Economics\n",
    "A part of the economic literature is well aware of the need for uncertainty quantification. However, with few exceptions (see, e.g., [Harenberg et al. (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE866), [Ratto (2008)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10614-007-9110-6) and [Nordhaus et al. (2015)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21637) this need is not adressed in practice.  \n",
    "In modern economics, we use dynamic economic models to formalize the objectives, trade-offs, and uncertainties faced by individuals when making optimal decisions. A illustrative example for the need of UQ in Economics are Utility Functions. These are the most basic functions that usually characterize the behavior and preferences of the agents that populate our models. Utility is a function of a set of parameters such as risk aversion or time preference. These parameters are highly uncertain given the current state of the respective microeconometric literature. Without Uncertainty Quantification being a standard in economics, it is current practice to simply select a parameter value that another autor has selected before. Therefore, estimations and forecasts are typically derived based on models with input paramters that are more or less chosen arbitrarily.  \n",
    "Our interest is to make a contribution to our profession by applying state-of-the-art tools from Uncertainty Quantification to our economic models in our research practice."

    "Our model of choice is the Discrete Occupation Choice Dynamic Programming Model in Keane and Wolpin (1994). In short, the model is solved by applying Maximum Likelihood estimations to a set of occupational choices in each iteration of the Value Function Iteration algorithm. The number of input parameters is 26 and we have estimates for mean and covariance for each of those input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code propagates the uncertainty from the model's input parameter to one model output. Our QoI is the effect of a tuition subsidy on the average number of schooling years. We plot the Convergence of the Mean of our Quantity of Interest compared to our Quantity of Interest under mean paramtrization for 10k iterations. We also show the distribution of the QoI."
